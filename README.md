## Just a simple launcher

The only meaningful thing this does is to start a new process in a new process group. I use it mainly in i3 for launching programs via fzf from an ephemeral cmdline window. Nothing much at all really.

I just compile and install it like this:

```
make install PREFIX=~/Local
```
